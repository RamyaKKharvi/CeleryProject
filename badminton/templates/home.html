    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Badminton is a competitive sport that requires speed, agility and skill on the court.
            A badminton match consists of the best-of-three games of 21 points.
            It is a racquet sport in which two or four players hit a shuttlecock back and forth using racquets held crosswise.
            The shuttlecock is very light. Playing badminton is an excellent exercise for the body.
            It strengthens muscles, enhances reflexes and motor coordination, increases flexibility and improves balance.
            It helps with these things better than other sports because it uses every muscle in the body</p>
